}
\arguments{
\item{X}{input and it must be a vector}

\item{cc}{nominal Phase I charting constant. If this is given, the function will not re-compute the charting constant.}

\item{fap0}{nominal false Alarm Probabilty in Phase I}

\item{order}{order for ARMA model}

\item{plot.option}{- draw a plot for the process; FALSE - Not draw a plot for the process}

\item{interval}{searching range of charting constants for the exact method}

\item{case}{known or unknown case.  When case = 'U', the parameters are estimated}

\item{phi.vec}{vector of autoregressive coefficient(s).  When case = 'K', the vector needs to be provided with the length same as the first value in the order.  If autoregressive coefficents does not present, phi needs to be NULL}

\item{theta.vec}{vector of moving-average coefficient(s).  When case = 'K', the vector needs to be provided with the length same as the third value in the order.  If moving-average coefficents does not present, theta needs to be NULL}

\item{mu0}{value of the IC process mean.  When case = 'K', the value needs to be provided.}

\item{sigma0}{value of the IC process standard deviation.  When case = 'K', the value needs to be provided.}

\item{method}{estimation method for the control chart. When method = 'MLE+MOM' is maximum likehood estimations plus method of moments. Other options are 'MLE' which is pure MLE and 'CSS' which is pure CSS.}

\item{nsim.coefs}{number of simulation for coeficients.}

\item{nsim.process}{number of simulation for ARMA processes}

\item{burn.in}{number of burn-ins.  When burn.in = 0, the simulated process is assumed to be in the initial stage.  When burn.in is large enough, the simulated process is assumed to be in the stable stage.}

\item{sim.type}{type of simulation.  When sim.type = 'Matrix', the simulation is generated using matrix computation.  When sim.type = 'Recursive', the simulation is based on a recursion.}

\item{transform}{type of transformation. When transform = 'none', no transformation is performed. When transform = 'boxcox', the Box-Cox transformation is used. When transform = 'yeojohnson', the Yeo-Johnson transformation is used.}

\item{lambda}{parameter used in the transformation.}

\item{standardize}{Output standardized data instead of raw data.}

\item{verbose}{print diagnostic information about fap0 and the charting constant during the simulations for the exact method}

\description{
Build a Phase I individual control chart for the ARMA models. The charting constant is corrected by this approach.

\examples{
# load the data in the package as an example
data(preston_data)

# set number of simulations
nsim.process <- 10
nsim.coefs <- 10

# An example using the default setting whose fap0 = 0.1
PH1ARMA(preston_data, nsim.process = nsim.process, nsim.coefs = nsim.coefs)

# When users get an error message about the size of matrix,
# the function needs to use the alternative simulation type as follows
PH1ARMA(preston_data, fap0 = 0.05, 
	nsim.process = nsim.process, nsim.coefs = nsim.coefs, sim.type = 'Recursive')
