Phase I Shewhart X-bar Control Chart
}
\description{
The utility of this package is in building a Shewhart-type control chart based on new methods for subgrouped and individual data. The Phase I chart is based on the multivariate normal/t or ARMA process.

Function 'PH1XBAR' builds a Phase I Shewhart X-bar/individual control chart with a correct charting constant.
Function 'getCC.XBAR' gets a charting constant for the data with a balanced one-way random effects model.
Function 'PH1ARMA' builds a Phase I individual control chart with an ARMA model using a correct charting constant.
Function 'getCC.ARMA' gets a charting constant for the data with an ARMA model.
