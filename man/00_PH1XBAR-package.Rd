Shewhart X-bar Control Chart in Phase I and in Phase II
}
\description{
The utility of this package is in building a Shewhart-type control chart based on new methods for the charting statistics, subgroup means. In Phase I, the chart is based on multivariate normal/t distribution. In Phase II, the chart is based on the uncondtional method or the exceedance probability criterion.
